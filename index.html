<h1><b> Top 10 Basketball Players Of All Time! </b></h1>
<h2>10.  10.Shaquille O'Neal. 23.7 PPG, 10.9 RPG, 2.3 BPG<h2>

<h3>The Hall of Fame center transformed the game with a combination of agility and explosiveness and size, the likes of which the league had never seen. A four-time NBA champion and three-time Finals MVP, O'Neal averaged a double-double during a career that spanned almost two decades. O'Neal became an All-Star 15 times and earned the 1999-2000 MVP award. The fun-loving big man used his outsize personality to become a global pitchman and analyst after retiring.</h3>

  <h4>9. Kobe Bryant. 25.0 PPG, 5.2 RPG, 4.7 APG, 1.4 SPG, 1.4 3s PG

For all of his statistical achievements -- the five championships, the 81-point game, the 60-point finale, the league MVP in 2008, the 20 seasons all with the same franchise -- Bryant's lasting legacy is his mental edge and burning desire to master the sport. "Mamba mentality" became more than a kitschy catchphrase after Bryant died; it is now a blueprint for how to chase your dreams. He'll forever be on the short list of players you'd want to take the last shot with the game on the line. </h4>

<h5>8. Tim Duncan. 19.0 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 3.0 APG, 2.2 BPG

Perhaps the only perceived knock on Duncan's game was that he was boring. He was known as "The Big Fundamental," dominating for nearly two decades on both ends of the floor with textbook simplicity, such as his midrange bank shot and perfect position defense. More than anything, Duncan was one of the best winners, leading the Spurs to five titles and 1,001 regular-season victories, the most for any player with one team in NBA history.19.0 PPG, 10.8 RPG, 3.0 APG, 2.2 BPG

<h6>7 Larry Bird. 24.3 PPG, 10.0 RPG, 6.3 APG, 1.7 SPG

Bird and Magic Johnson revitalized the NBA -- and the Celtics-Lakers rivalry. Bird led Boston to five NBA Finals and three championships with a blend of shot-making, passing and his feel for the game. He was the league MVP in three consecutive seasons (1984-86), something only Wilt Chamberlain and Bill Russell had accomplished. Until LeBron James came along, Bird was hailed as the best small forward ever.</h6>

<h7>6. Wilt Chamberlain. 30.1 PPG, 22.9 RPG, 4.4 APG

Chamberlain was truly ahead of his time. His numbers -- including scoring an NBA-record 100 points in a single game and averaging 50 points per game for an entire season -- are mythical. The only reason he doesn't rank higher on lists of the all-time greats is he won "only" two NBA championships.</h7>

<h8> 5.Magic Johnson. 19.5 PPG, 7.2 RPG, 11.2 APG, 1.9 SPG

Johnson revolutionized the game, entering the league as the tallest point guard in league history at 6-foot-9. He was a legendary winner, a transcendent passer, an instant highlight and a triple-double waiting to happen. Without Johnson and his rivalry for the ages with Bird and the Celtics, the NBA may not be where it is today. The charismatic Johnson took the "Showtime" Lakers to nine NBA Finals, and they won five titles. His fast breaks and no-look passes catapulted the NBA from an era when Finals games weren't televised live to the global game it is today.</h8>
